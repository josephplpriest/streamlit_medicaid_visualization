1,a & d,Vitamins A And D,"This medication is used as a moisturizer to treat or prevent dry, rough, scaly, itchy skin and minor skin irritations (e.g., diaper rash, skin burns from radiation therapy). Emollients are substances that soften and moisturize the skin and decrease itching and flaking. Some products (e.g., zinc oxide, white petrolatum) are used mostly to protect the skin against irritation (e.g., from wetness). Dry skin is caused by a loss of water in the upper layer of the skin. Emollients/moisturizers work by forming an oily layer on the top of the skin that traps water in the skin. Petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil and dimethicone are common emollients. Humectants, including glycerin, lecithin, and propylene glycol, draw water into the outer layer of skin. Many products also have ingredients that soften the horny substance (keratin) that holds the top layer of skin cells together (including urea, alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic/citric/glycolic acid, and allantoin). This helps the dead skin cells fall off, helps the skin keep in more water, and leaves the skin feeling smoother and softer."

Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems. This product contains two medications. Bisoprolol is a beta blocker that works by blocking the effect of certain natural chemicals (e.g., epinephrine) on the heart and blood vessels. This slows your heartbeat, lowers blood pressure, and reduces strain on the heart. Hydrochlorothiazide is a ""water pill"" (diuretic) that works by increasing the amount of urine that you make. This causes your body to get rid of extra salt and water, which probably helps to relax the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily. These two drugs are used together when one medication is not controlling your blood pressure. Using these two drugs together can also reduce the amount of each drug you must take, thereby decreasing the chances of side effects."

Formoterol belongs to the class of drugs known as long-acting beta agonists. It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways so that they open up and you can breathe more easily. Controlling symptoms of breathing problems can decrease time lost from work or school. When used alone, long-acting beta agonists (such as formoterol) may rarely increase the risk of serious (sometimes fatal) asthma-related breathing problems. However, combination inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonists, such as this product, do not increase the risk of serious asthma-related breathing problems. For asthma treatment, this product should be used when breathing problems are not well controlled with one asthma-control medication (such as inhaled corticosteroid) or if your symptoms need combination treatment. Before using this medication, it is important to learn how to use it properly. This medication must be used regularly to be effective. It does not work right away and should not be used to relieve sudden asthma attacks. If an asthma attack occurs, use your quick-relief inhaler (such as albuterol, also called salbutamol in some countries) as prescribed."

1152,dry skin lotion,Glycerin/Mineral Oil,"This medication is used as a moisturizer to treat or prevent dry, rough, scaly, itchy skin and minor skin irritations (e.g., diaper rash, skin burns from radiation therapy). Emollients are substances that soften and moisturize the skin and decrease itching and flaking. Some products (e.g., zinc oxide, white petrolatum) are used mostly to protect the skin against irritation (e.g., from wetness). Dry skin is caused by a loss of water in the upper layer of the skin. Emollients/moisturizers work by forming an oily layer on the top of the skin that traps water in the skin. Petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil and dimethicone are common emollients. Humectants, including glycerin, lecithin, and propylene glycol, draw water into the outer layer of skin. Many products also have ingredients that soften the horny substance (keratin) that holds the top layer of skin cells together (including urea, alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic/citric/glycolic acid, and allantoin). This helps the dead skin cells fall off, helps the skin keep in more water, and leaves the skin feeling smoother and softer."

It is used by women with a uterus to help reduce symptoms of menopause (such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness) and to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis) after menopause. Conjugated estrogens are female hormones which help to decrease menopausal symptoms caused by the body making less estrogen. Bazedoxifene is not a hormone, but works by acting like estrogen (as a selective estrogen receptor modulator or SERM) in some parts of the body. The bazedoxifene in this medication helps to preserve bone mass and reduces the risk of cancer of the uterus which can be caused by using estrogen. If you are using this medication to treat symptoms only in and around the vagina, consider using products applied directly inside the vagina instead of medications that are taken by mouth, absorbed through the skin, or injected."
1155,duexis,Ibuprofen/FAmotidine,This combination medication is used to relieve pain from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis while decreasing the risk of developing an ulcer from ibuprofen use. It contains ibuprofen and famotidine. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by blocking your body's production of certain natural substances that cause inflammation.

1156,dulera,Mometasone/Formoterol,"This product is used to control and prevent symptoms (wheezing and shortness of breath) caused by asthma. It contains 2 medications: mometasone and formoterol. Mometasone belongs to a class of drugs known as corticosteroids. It works by reducing the irritation and swelling of the airways. Formoterol belongs to the class of drugs known as long-acting beta agonists. It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways so that they open up and you can breathe more easily. Controlling symptoms of breathing problems can decrease time lost from work or school. When used alone, long-acting beta agonists (such as formoterol) may rarely increase the risk of serious (sometimes fatal) asthma-related breathing problems. However, combination inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonists, such as this product, do not increase the risk of serious asthma-related breathing problems. This product should be used when breathing problems are not well controlled with one asthma-control medication (such as inhaled corticosteroid) or if your symptoms need combination treatment. Before using this medication, it is important to learn how to use it properly. This medication must be used regularly to be effective.

Norethindrone (a form of progestin) is a hormone that prevents pregnancy by making vaginal fluid thicker to help prevent sperm from reaching an egg (fertilization) and changing the lining of the uterus (womb) to prevent attachment of a fertilized egg. If a fertilized egg does not attach to the uterus, it passes out of the body. This medication also stops the release of an egg (ovulation) in about half of a woman's menstrual cycles. While the ""mini-pill"" is more effective than certain other methods of birth control (such as condoms, cervical cap, diaphragm), it is less effective than combination hormone (estrogen and progestin) birth control because it does not consistently prevent ovulation. It is usually used by women who cannot take estrogen. To reduce the risk of pregnancy, it is very important to take this medication exactly as prescribed.

Some products (e.g., zinc oxide, white petrolatum) are used mostly to protect the skin against irritation (e.g., from wetness). Dry skin is caused by a loss of water in the upper layer of the skin. Emollients/moisturizers work by forming an oily layer on the top of the skin that traps water in the skin. Petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil and dimethicone are common emollients. Humectants, including glycerin, lecithin, and propylene glycol, draw water into the outer layer of skin. Many products also have ingredients that soften the horny substance (keratin) that holds the top layer of skin cells together (including urea, alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic/citric/glycolic acid, and allantoin).

It is used by women to help reduce symptoms of menopause (such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness). These symptoms are caused by the body making less estrogen. The progestin in this medication helps to reduce the risk of cancer of the uterus which can be caused by using estrogen. Women who have had their uterus removed do not need the progestin and therefore should not use this combination medication. If you are using this medication to treat symptoms only in and around the vagina, products applied directly inside the vagina should be considered before medications that are taken by mouth, absorbed through the skin, or injected. This medication may also be used by women after menopause to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis). However, there are other medications (such as raloxifene, bisphosphonates including alendronate) that are also effective in preventing bone loss and may be safer.

2059,lansoprazol-amoxicil-clarithro,Lansoprazole/Amoxiciln/Clarith,"This product is used to treat stomach/intestinal ulcers caused by the bacteria H. pylori and to prevent the ulcers from returning. Treating an ulcer reduces the risk of serious damage to the lining of the stomach/intestines (such as bleeding, tearing, blockage). Lansoprazole is known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by blocking acid production in the stomach. Decreasing excess stomach acid can help the ulcer heal. Amoxicillin and clarithromycin are antibiotics used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections (including H. pylori). Treating the infection helps reduce the risk of the ulcer returning. Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic and clarithromycin is a macrolide-type antibiotic. They work by stopping the growth of bacteria. The antibiotics in this product treat only bacterial infections. Antibiotics do not work for viral infections (such as common cold, flu). Using any antibiotic when it is not needed can cause it to not work for future infections.

3925,vaqta,Hepatitis A Virus Vaccine/PF,"This vaccine is used to help prevent infection from the hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis A infection can be mild with no symptoms or a severe illness that can rarely cause liver failure and death. Preventing infection can prevent these problems. Hepatitis A vaccine is made from whole, killed hepatitis A virus. It does not contain live virus, so you cannot get hepatitis from the vaccine. This vaccine works by helping the body produce immunity (through antibody production) that will prevent you from getting infection from hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis A vaccine does not protect you from other virus infections (such as HIV virus, which causes AIDS; hepatitis B, hepatitis C or hepatitis E; HPV virus, which causes genital warts and other problems). The vaccine is recommended for people aged 12 months and older, especially those at an increased risk of getting the infection. Those at an increased risk include people who live with or spend much time with people with hepatitis A infections, institutional or daycare workers, lab workers, people with multiple sex partners, men who have sex with men, sex workers, injecting and non-injecting drug abusers, and people traveling to high-risk areas."

3927,varivax vaccine,Varicella Vaccine Live/PF,"This vaccine is used to help prevent varicella virus infection (commonly known as chickenpox). Chickenpox is a common childhood illness, but can cause more serious illnesses in people who have not yet had either chickenpox or this vaccine. Serious (rarely fatal) problems (such as pneumonia and inflammation of the liver or brain) may rarely occur from this infection, and first-time infections in adults may be very severe. It may also cause a very serious brain/liver condition called Reyes syndrome in children or teenagers. If you are infected while pregnant, your unborn infant may be harmed. Vaccination during childhood may help prevent this infection and the problems that can occur. The virus in this vaccine is alive, but it has been weakened (attenuated) and therefore has a decreased ability to cause illness. It works by helping the body produce immunity (protection) that will prevent you from getting chickenpox, or will lessen the seriousness of the infection. As with any vaccine, it may not fully protect everyone who receives it. People who get chickenpox after getting the vaccine usually have mild cases with fewer blisters, fewer fevers, and faster recoveries. The vaccine is recommended for children 12 months and older and adults who have not had chickenpox or received a varicella vaccination before."

It contains 2 medications: fluticasone and salmeterol. Fluticasone belongs to a class of drugs known as corticosteroids. It works by reducing the irritation and swelling of the airways. Salmeterol belongs to the class of drugs known as long-acting beta agonists. It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways so that they open up and you can breathe more easily. Controlling symptoms of breathing problems can decrease time lost from work or school. When used alone, long-acting beta agonists (such as salmeterol) may rarely increase the risk of serious (sometimes fatal) asthma-related breathing problems. However, combination inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonists, such as this product, do not increase the risk of serious asthma-related breathing problems. For asthma treatment, this product should be used when breathing problems are not well controlled with one asthma-control medication (such as inhaled corticosteroid) or if your symptoms need combination treatment. Before using this medication, it is important to learn how to use it properly. This medication must be used regularly to be effective. It does not work right away and should not be used to relieve sudden asthma attacks. If an asthma attack occurs, use your quick-relief inhaler (such as albuterol, also called salbutamol in some countries) as prescribed."

It is used to reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack in people who have had ""mini-strokes"" (transient ischemic attacks), or a stroke due to a blood clot, or who have heart disease. This product is used by people who are at risk for developing ulcers while taking aspirin. Aspirin belongs to a class of drugs known as antiplatelets.
